# Legacy MERN Stack Website

This repository contains one of my earliest full-stack web projects, developed using the **MERN** stack: **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React**, and **Node.js**.  
It represents the starting point of my journey as a full-stack developer, where I first explored how frontend and backend systems work together in a production-ready environment.

## ðŸ“… Project History

- **Initialized:** September 2021  
- **Stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)  
- **Status:** Archived / Legacy  
- **Purpose:** Personal website and playground to apply full-stack concepts

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

This was my first experience building a complete full-stack application from scratch.  
I worked on:
- Setting up custom backend API endpoints using Express.js
- Building dynamic frontend components with React (CRA)
- Managing server-side rendering and database logic via MongoDB
- Deploying the site manually without modern CI/CD pipelines

Although itâ€™s no longer actively maintained and relies on older technologies, it still reflects the core of my long-term passion for React and web development.

## ðŸš€ Evolution

Since this project, Iâ€™ve significantly improved my tech stack and practices.  
Today, I build modern, scalable applications using:
- **Next.js** and **TypeScript** for frontend
- **PostgreSQL** with **Prisma ORM**
- **Redux Toolkit Query** for advanced state and data handling
- **CI/CD pipelines** via **GitHub Actions**
- Deployed to platforms like **Railway** for seamless backend hosting

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Full-stack architecture design
- RESTful API principles
- Component-based frontend development
- Handling state and async operations in React
- Deployment process without automation tools

Thanks for checking out one of the roots of my React journey!
